## Problem Statement

The interactive dashboard is built with Executive summary, Product and customer Details. Drill down option enables the user to drill down by individual product or customer from executive Summary. 

## Dataset
[Dataset](Dataset) includes [Calendar](Dataset/AdventureWorks_Calendar.csv) , [Customers](Dataset/AdventureWorks_Customers.csv) , [Product_Categories](Dataset/AdventureWorks_Product_Categories.csv) , [Product_Subcategories](Dataset/AdventureWorks_Product_Subcategories.csv) , [Products.csv](Dataset/AdventureWorks_Products.csv), [Returns](Dataset/AdventureWorks_Returns.csv) , [Territories](Dataset/AdventureWorks_Territories.csv) data of Adventures Works.


# STEPS:
### 1. Connecting & Shaping Data with Power BI Desktop

The raw data set came in .csv format and was imported to Power BI directly. A total of 8 files were imported, each being their own table. Here I was able to get a general overview of the data set and saw that I would primarily be working with Sales and Returns data. I then began cleaning the data by ensuring columns were titled appropriately, they were in their correct data types, looking for missing data (which there was none) and began looking for what relationships I might be able to create between these tables.


### 2. Creating Table Relationships & Data Models in Power BI.

After ensuring my data’s accuracy and consistency, I began the process of creating a data model for my tables. I first established my data tables which are ‘Sales Data’ and ‘Returns Data’ then set work creating relationships between tables. For this project I did not find it necessary to use any relationships other than one to many. A picture of the completed model is provided for greater understanding.
